# installation
You do not need any installation to start developing or using it. You just need to clone it from my [github page](https://github.com/mohammad-mohammadi88/SASS-SCSS) with running the command below and open the index.html file in assets.
 `git clone https://github.com/mohammad-mohammadi88/SASS-SCSS`
